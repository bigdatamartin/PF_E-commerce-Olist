### **Context**

>In 2021, the retail sales through e-commerce meant an approximate balance of 5.2 trillion dollars worldwide and it's said that this figure will increase by 56% in the coming years, reaching 8.1 trillion in 2026.

>Olist is a Brazilian company that provides e-commerce services for SMEs <i>(Small and Medium-sized Enterprises)</i> that works as a marketplace, that is, it works as a "store of stores" where different sellers can offer their products to final consumers.

### **Role to develop**

Our role is an international consultant called "Alpha Insights" which is made up of 5 members, each with a specialty and a specific job position.

With the primary goal of continuing to connect small businesses (*SMEs*) with larger markets and improving the user experience, Olist hires us as external consultants to find innovative solutions that allows its users to sell their products to a greater number of customers.
To achieve this, it provides them with their data from 2016 to 2018, so they must deliver an MVP (*Minimum Viable Product*).

## **Proposal**

Our proposal is based primarily on:

- `Collect, refine and make information available:`
    * An Exploratory Data Analysis (*EDA*) was carried out and a Data Quality report was prepared (missing data, outliers, null values), the criteria used for its management, as well as a data dictionary.
    * Data Pipelines were created for the ETL (*Data Extraction, Transformation and Load Process*).
    - The database (*DataWarehouse*) of the different csv provided and the alternative sources that were incorporated was generated. It is running on a cloud service provider (*AWS*) and On-premise (locally).
    - Workflow automation (*Airflow*).

- `Significant report and analysis:`
    * The analysis has a **dashboard** that provides concise information for business decision-making, exposing key metrics and **KPIs** for good performance and improvement of e-commerce.

- `Training and putting into production a machine learning model`:
    * A **Product Recommendation Model** and a **Sentiment Analysis** model on reviews were implemented.
